# The Boggle Problem
This is a project template that describes the so-called 'Boggle' challenge, sometimes used during technical interviews for computer programming candidates.

The problem can be stated thus:

> Given a grid of NxM letters and a dictionary, display a list of all the words that can be constructed from the letters of sequentially adjacent locations, where "adjacent locations" are those horizontally and vertically neighboring (not diagonally). Words must be at least three letters long and cannot use the same location more than once per word.

This is called the Boggle Challenge because it resembles the [Boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) board game.


# Materials
Provided here is a skeleton (Xcode, but can be migrated to another environment pretty easily) project that provides an environment in which the candidate only needs to concern themselves with solving the problem, not reading files from disk or how to populate a grid with letters.

The materials provided are:
- Source code to the scaffolding
- A `dictionary` file (could be .txt or .json depending on the language) that the scaffold uses to create the dictionary data
- Xcode project so you can see the structure etc. and for you to try to solve it if you want
- This Readme that describes the challenge
- A [separate document for interviewers](INTERVIEWERS.md) that provides a detailed discussion of the problem along with follow-up discussion points and exercises (separate from the Readme so as to not spoil the solution)


# Planned Changes
Currently, the source code is in C, Objective-C, and Swift, but it is my plan to add other languages. If you have a desire, you can provide the materials in your favorite language in a pull request so they can be included. (And thank you!)
